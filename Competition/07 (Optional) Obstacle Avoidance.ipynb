    "<font size =3> Have you ever been in a car when the emergency auto brakes went on? What happened? How was the car able to tell when to stop? Self-driving cars need to be able to avoid obstacles in an emergency. Instead of infrared, they use more advanced sensors like **LIDAR** (Light Imaging Detection and Ranging) and **RADAR**. LIDAR uses laser light to map out the environment while RADAR uses radio waves. Despite not having this technology, Zumi can still avoid obstacles! </font>\n",

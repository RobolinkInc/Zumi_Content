This year’s challenge will require you to really master some of Zumi’s AI capabilities by utilizing her camera to recognize a STOP sign, teaching her about red and green, and reading QR codes to navigate the field. For this challenge, you’ll be coding in Blockly or Python. If you are going to write Python code for this competition, you're in the right place! </font>\n",

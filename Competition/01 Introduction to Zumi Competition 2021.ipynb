    "<font size =3> Join the competition from anywhere this year, and put your AI knowledge to the test! The challenge is called Cruise to the Park. This year’s challenge will require you to really master some of Zumi’s AI capabilities by utilizing her camera to recognize a STOP sign, teaching her about red and green, and reading QR codes to navigate the field. For this challenge, you’ll be coding in Blockly or Python. If you are going to write Python code for this competition, you're in the right place! If you would like to see some general info about the competition, check out the webpage [here](https://shop.robolink.com/pages/irc-2021).</font>\n",

    "<font size =3>The competition is split up into three separate challenges. The first one involves using QR codes to tell Zumi where to park. The second one requires zumi to stop at a stop sign and then move through a road segment without touching any walls after the stop sign has been removed. For the third challenge, Zumi must stop at a red card and wait until the card is swapped to a green card. Afterwards, Zumi must follow the line path until it reaches the QR code and reads it, continuing in the direction stored in the QR code until she reachs the finish line. </font>\n",

    "## What is an image?\n",
    "<font size =3> An image is made up of an array of small dots called The **pixels** (short for picture element). A pixel can be a single color or a combination of colors, and each of those colors is represented by a series of three numbers that tell you exactly how much red, green, and blue are in it. This is called the **RGB** value, which stands for red, green, and blue. For example, a beautiful shade of turquoise might look something like (27, 209, 197) since there isn’t a lot of red, but there is a lot of green and blue. Because each value of RGB can be between 0 and 255, there are 256 values to choose from for each color. That results in 256^3, or 16,777,216, different color combinations! </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a matrix?\n",
    "<font size =3> Since each pixel can be represented by numbers, a picture is a grid of numbers. This is where humans and computers start to see images a little differently. Humans see colors and shapes that we recognize as different objects, but computers only see this grid of numbers, also called **matrices**. Each number represents the RGB value of each pixel. They look a little like this: </font>\n",

    "## Using HSV instead of RGB\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size =3> In this activity, you trained Zumi to recognize different colors. You used the camera to collect training data pictures, and then ran a special classifier to classify the colors. The computer processed all the number values of the image matrix to label each color, and then used those values to guess the colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned about the RGB colorspace, but this program converted each RGB image to the **HSV** colorspace. HSV stands for hue, saturation, and value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hue** normally ranges from 0-360 and represents the color (in this application however, it ranges from 0-180)\n",
    "* **Saturation** is the color's intensity\n",
    "* **Value** is how light or dark the color is\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer vision applications, it is better to use the HSV colorspace since it separates values for colors and intensity. This is important because shadows, reflections, and other factors may cause certain colors look very different. The HSV colorspace takes this into account for more accurate results. </font>\n",

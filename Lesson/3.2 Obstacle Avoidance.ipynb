    "Have you ever been in a car when the emergency auto brakes went on? What happened? How was the car able to tell when to stop? Self-driving cars need to be able to avoid obstacles in an emergency. Instead of infrared, they use more advanced sensors like **LIDAR** (Light Imaging Detection and Ranging) and **RADAR**. LIDAR uses laser light to map out the environment while RADAR uses radio waves. Despite not having this technology, Zumi can still avoid obstacles!\n",

    "Before going into code, let's discuss the pseudocode for this program. How should Zumi avoid obstacles?\n",
    "First think about how humans avoid obstacles. If something is on our right, we go left. If something is our left, we go right. If something is directly in front of us, we have to either turn around or go around by turning away from the obtacle. Zumi uses the IR sensors to \"see\" and will make a decision based on the sensor data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "read the data from IR sensors\n",
    "if both sensors are triggered, turn 180 degrees\n",
    "if right sensor is triggered, turn left\n",
    "if left sensor is triggered, turn right\n",
    "else keep going forward\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of turning when the sensor is trigged, we are actually going to change the heading by +30 or -30 degrees. You are going to use the same function from Red Light Green Light which is ```go_straight()``` because it needs to be continuously driving and checking. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the pseudocode will look something like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "read the data from IR sensors\n",
    "if both sensors are triggered, reverse and change heading by 180 degrees\n",
    "if right sensor is triggered, change heading by +30 degrees (for a left turn)\n",
    "if left sensor is triggered, change heading by -30 degrees (for a right turn)\n",
    "go in the direction set by heading\n",

    "\n",

    "Second, this code uses a timer which will automatically stop when the desired time limit is up.\n",

    "time_elapsed = 0\n",

    "<font size =3> Have you ever been in a car when the emergency auto brakes went on? What happened? How was the car able to tell when to stop? Self-driving cars need to be able to avoid obstacles in an emergency. Instead of infrared, they use more advanced sensors like **LIDAR** (Light Imaging Detection and Ranging) and **RADAR**. LIDAR uses laser light to map out the environment while RADAR uses radio waves. Despite not having this technology, Zumi can still avoid obstacles! </font>\n",

    "### Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size =3> Before going into code, let's discuss the pseudocode for this program. How should Zumi avoid obstacles?\n",
    "First think about how humans avoid obstacles. If something is on our right, we go left. If something is our left, we go right. If something is directly in front of us, we have to either turn around or go around by turning away from the obtacle. Zumi uses the IR sensors to \"see\" and will make a decision based on the sensor data: <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font face=\"Courier\">\n",
    "read the data from IR sensors <br>\n",
    "if both sensors are triggered, turn 180 degrees <br>\n",
    "if right sensor is triggered, turn left <br>\n",
    "if left sensor is triggered, turn right <br>\n",
    "else keep going forward <br> \n",
    "</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../Data/images/zumi_maze.jpg\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of turning when the sensor is trigged, we are actually going to change the heading by +30 or -30 degrees. Instead of using <font face=\"Courier\">forward()</font> (which has a built-in stop), you will use <font face=\"Courier\">go_straight()</font> because it needs to be continuously driving and checking. This function *only* works inside of a loop.\n",

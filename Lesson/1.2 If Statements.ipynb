    "If statements are conditionals, which are used to help your program make decisions. You actually use conditionals every day! Some examples might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If my alarm goes off, then I will wake up. Else, I will stay asleep.\n",
    "* If I am hungry, I will eat something.\n",
    "* If it's sunny out, I will wear sunscreen.\n",
    "* If my room is clean, I will get my allowance. Else, I will make no money.\n",
    "\n",
    "If statements are written like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if insert condition here:\n",

    "* If the condition is true, the computer will execute, or carry out, the statements underneath it.\n",
    "* If the condition is false, the computer will NOT execute the statements underneath it.\n",
    "* \"Else” has no condition! This is because “else” is the last option when using if-else statements.  When a computer reaches the “else” option after checking all the other conditions, then the else condition is automatically true and will run its statements.\n",
    "* One way to use “else” would be when something needs to happen when a condition is false. When the \"if\" condition is false and nothing needs to happen, don’t use an “else”.\n",

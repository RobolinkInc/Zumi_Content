    "<font size =3> **Infrared** (IR for short) is a form of electromagnetic radiation that is not visible with the human eye. It’s also a form of energy. However, as scary as the name sounds, not all electromagnetic radiation is dangerous. There is a small portion of it that we can see, meaning this is visible light! The different colors that we see depend on the various wavelengths. As the wavelengths get longer, the colors become less visible to humans. However, special sensors can detect these waves. You will use the IR sensors on Zumi to detect objects that are covering the sensors. </font>\n",

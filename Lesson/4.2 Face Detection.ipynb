    "\n",
    "<font size =3> You might have tried the *Smile and Drive* or *Who am I?* demos and seen that Zumi can detect faces. If you haven't yet, they are under production and will be released soon! Don't worry, you can still work through this lesson. How does face detection work? Start by thinking about how humans detect faces. Do you think a computer does the same thing? </font>\n",

    "## Haar cascade\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size =3> Before looking at a face, let's look at an example that has fewer features. You have no problem identifying the sign below as a stop sign, but how do you know it's a stop sign? What difficulties will a computer have in trying to do the same task?\n",

    "<img src=\"../Data/images/blank_stop_sign.png\" width=200>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size =3> The easiest way to identify that this is a stop sign is by identifying particular **features**, such as color and shape. You can train a computer to recognize a stop sign by collefcting multiple pictures of stop signs, called positive images, as well as images that do not have stop signs, called negative images. The model that is produced is known as a **Haar cascade**. This process is similar to how humans learn. We are exposed to signs that are stop signs and to signs that are not.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Haar features\n",
    "<font size =3> A Haar cascade is named after a mathematical function, but it was invented by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in 2001 (Source). They based their algorithm on the idea that certain features, called **Haar features**, can represent objects. <br>\n",
    "Think back to the lesson on color classification. Remember that an image is a set of pixels, and each pixel in the color image is normally represented by a set of three numbers. Now convert that stop sign image to grayscale. \n",
    "\n",
    "Source: http://www.willberger.org/cascade-haar-explained/ <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../Data/images/convert_stop_sign.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "In a grayscale image, you only need one number to represent each pixel instead of three. The lowest value is 0, representing black, and the highest value is 255, representing white. Any value in between is a shade of grey.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../Data/images/grayscale_values.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, you can start to understand Haar features. In a stop sign, there will be a certain pattern of lighter pixels representing the letters in \"STOP\" and slightly darker pixels surrounding them. Now apply this concept to a human face. Faces have multiple features, incuding eyes, noses, and mouths. If you feed the computer multiple grayscale images of faces, it will start to find a pattern in the average pixel values. Down the bridge of the nose, it is more likely to find a column of lighter pixels surrounded by darker pixels on the sides. The computer might also find that the area with our eyes and eyebrows generally has darker pixels than our cheeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../Data/images/haar_cascade.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the computer isn’t aware of what it’s looking at, it can see pixel value patterns in certain arrangements (for example, your nose wouldn’t be above your eyes) to classify the image as a human face. These are the Haar features that the program will be looking for when presented with a new image it has never seen before.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code\n",
    "<font size =3> Training a Haar Cascade is time-consuming. To make a really good classifier, you would need thousands of positive and negative images and some computing power. For detecting faces, the cascade file has already been provided for you! It’s a file with thousands of lines of code that contain all of the information for classifying whatever it was trained to detect. </font>\n",

    "### Import libraries\n",
    "<font size =3>First, you need to import all of the necessary libraries. You will need the camera library for taking pictures, the vision library for detecting faces, and the screen library for drawing on the screen. </font>"

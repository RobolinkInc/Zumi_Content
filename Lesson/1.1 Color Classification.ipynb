    "\n",
    "Have you ever thought about how a computer can see color and differentiate between colors? In this lesson you will learn how to using a special **algorithm** to teach Zumi different colors. This is a very basic example of machine learning. Machine learning can be summarized in three steps: \n",
    "* Gathering data\n",
    "* Generating a model\n",
    "* Making predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, Zumi has only known about black and white. You will use Zumi's camera to take many pictures of your favorite colors, then run code that will use the color information to label each color. In the final step, you will be able to test your model and write code for Zumi to react to each one differently! For now, let's teach Zumi about colors.\n",

    "## What is an image?\n",
    "An image is made up of an array of **pixels** (short for picture element). A pixel can be a single color or a combination of colors. The colors are represented by number values in a particular range. For example, you may have heard of the **RGB** colorspace before. If you look closely at your computer screen or phone with a microscope, you would find that each color is actually a combination of red, greed, and blue (RGB) pixels. We can create millions of combinations! Why? Each value of RGB can be between 0 and 255. With 256 values to choose from for each color, that results in 256^3 combinations, or 16,777,216!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a matrix?\n",
    "Since each pixel can be represented by numbers, a picture is a grid of numbers. Whereas humans see colors and shapes that we recognize as different objects, computers only see this grid of numbers.\n",
    "These grids of numbers are called **matrices** where each number represents the intensity of either red, green, or blue on a scale from 0 to 255. They look a little like this:\n",

    "## Using HSV instead of RGB\n",
    "In this activity, you will use train Zumi to recognize different colors. You will use the camera to collect training data pictures then run a special classifier to classify the colors. Remember that the computer will process all the number values of the image matrix to label each color, then use those values to guess the colors later. \n",
    "\n",
    "You learned about the RGB colorspace, but this program will be converting each RGB image to the **HSV colorspace**. HSV stands for hue, saturation, and value. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hue** ranges from 0-360 and determines the color\n",
    "* **Saturation** ranges from 0-100% and refers to how much gray is in the color, determining the colorâ€™s intensity\n",
    "* **Value** ranges from 0-100% and refers to how light or dark the color is\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer vision applications, it is better to use the HSV colorspace since it separates values for colors and intensity. This is important because shadows, reflections, and other factors may cause certain colors look very different. The HSV colorspace takes this into account for more accurate results.\n",

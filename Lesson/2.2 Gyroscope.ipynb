    "<font size =3> When you made your remote control, Zumi turned left or right using the number of degrees that you gave as a parameter. How does Zumi know how many degrees she is turning? Zumi is equipped with an **MPU**, or motion processing unit, and has two very important sensors that are necessary for driving straight and making accurate turns: the **gyroscope** and **accelerometer**. This lesson is about the gyroscope. Youâ€™ll learn about the accelerometer later! </font>\n",

    "## What is a gyroscope?\n",
    "<font size =3> When you think of a gyroscope, you may be thinking of a mounted, spinning wheel that stays balanced in the same orientation, no matter which direction you turn or flip the gyroscope. How? This can be explained by conservation of momentum. While you may not have heard of this term before, you have experienced this. For example, if you have ever spun around on an office chair, you probably noticed you spin faster when you bring your arms and legs in. Since momentum has to be conserved, your speed increases when you bring your mass (arms and legs) closer to you.\n",

    "In electronics, gyroscopes don't look like this. They are tiny chips that also use motion to detect changes in orientation. For robotics, this device that measures rotation speed. Gyroscopes are important because we need rotation speed to calculate how many degrees Zumi has turned in a given amount of time. <br><br>\n",

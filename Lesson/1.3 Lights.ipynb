There are three LEDs on Zumi's left side that indicate the charging state, and one white LED on Zumi's right side that indicates the Pi started successfully. There are two LEDs at the front of the board for headlights. Don't get them confused with the Infrared (IR) sensors! You will learn about those later. The headlights are actually hidden by the shell. </font>\n",

    "# Gyroscope\n",
    "When you made the remote control, Zumi turned left or right the number of degrees that you gave as a parameter. How does Zumi know how many degrees she is turning? Zumi is equipped with an **MPU**, or motion processing unit. The MPU has two very important sensors that are necessary for driving straight and making accurate turns: the **gyrocope** and **accelerometer**. You will learn about the accelerometer in a later lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a gyroscope?\n",
    "A gyroscope is a device that measures rotation speed. This device is important because we need rotation speed to calculate how many degrees Zumi has turned.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering why rotation speed is necessary to figure out how much we've turned. Think about how we calculate distance when we're in a car. If you were driving 50 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, how far did you travel?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiply 50 by 2.5 and you get 125 miles. So to get distance we multipled time traveled by the speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this logic we can find how many angles we've \"traveled\" as long as we know how many angles we travel over time, which is given by the gyroscope as rotational speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to worry about the math behind the concept, but you will learn how to use the heading function in forward, reverse, left, and right.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access gyroscope values, you will need the Zumi object and the screen object for displaying values."

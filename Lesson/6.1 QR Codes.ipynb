    "**Binary** is the language that a computer uses. Since a computer is an electronic device, the computer has to send messages with electronic pulses. When the pulse is HIGH, it is interpreted as 1. When it is LOW, the computer interprets it as a 0. A computer can send these pulses extremely fast -- much faster than a human can even process! These individual values are called **bits**, which is short for **binary digit**, or a digit that can only have only two values. These two values are 0 and 1.</font>\n",

Think about how we represent the number 10. Instead of having a unique symbol for every number, we represent 10 with a one and a zero. The one represents that there is one multiple of 10<sup>1</sup> (ten to the first power), and the zero represents that there are zero multiples of 10<sup>0</sup>. (Remember that anything raised to the power of zero is equal to one.) Adding these two together gives you 10+0=10.\n",

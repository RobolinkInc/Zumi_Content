These codes are so popular because they are condensed labels that can easily be read by a computer. Many smartphones have built-in QR code scanners, but there are many other applications that can decode them. In this lesson, you will learn how QR codes work and how you can implement them into your Zumi world.\n",

    "**Binary** is the language that a computer uses. Since a computer is an electronic device, the computer has to send messages with electronic pulses. When the pulse is HIGH, it is interpreted as 1. When it is LOW, the computer interprets it as a 0. A computer can send these pulses extremely fast -- much faster than a human can even process! These individual values are called **bits**, which is short for **binary digit**, or a digit that can only have only two values. These two values are 0 and 1.</font>\n",

    "\n",
    "What if you only had ones and zeros to work with? Let's start counting up from zero. 0,1,... but how do we represent the number 2 without using another digit other than 1 or 0? Think about how we represent the number 10. Instead of having a unique symbol for every number, we represent 10 with a one and a zero. The one represents that there is one multiple of 10<sup>1</sup> (ten to the first power), and the zero represents that there are zero multiples of 10<sup>0</sup>. (Remember that anything raised to the power of zero is equal to one.) Adding these two together gives you 10+0=10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to binary: how can we represent the number 2 with only ones and zeros? Each place in the number will now represent a multiple of 2 instead of a multiple of 10.\n",

    "\n",
    "Following this idea, in the number 01001000, there is a 1 in the 2<sup>6</sup> place and a 1 in the 2<sup>3</sup> place. 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 64, and 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. If you add 64 and 8, you get 72. If you feel like you need extra practice with this, try this [code.org](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/iukLbcDnzqgoxuu810unLw) binary game out!\n",

Since computers can't understand letters, the **ASCII**, or American Standard Code for Information Interchange, table was made to come up with a number to represent common characters and symbols. Take a look at the ASCII table below and try to decipher the rest of this binary message. You can use scratch paper to make diagrams like the ones above. <br> <br>\n",

    "Good job if you got \"Hello!\", the same message that was encoded in the QR code. How does this binary code get translated to the QR code’s matrix of black and white squares? Remember that binary only uses two digits. This can also be represented by a black square or a white square, \"on\" or \"off\". If you wrap that message around like a snake into the shape of a square, you will get a QR code! There are a few more details and rules about the formatting, but the general idea is the same. Here is the QR code for \"wikipedia.org\" broken down:\n",

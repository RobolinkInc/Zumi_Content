Self-driving cars need to be able to avoid obstacles in an emergency. Instead of infrared, they use more advanced sensors like **LIDAR** (Light Imaging Detection and Ranging) and **RADAR**. LIDAR uses laser light to map out the environment while RADAR uses radio waves. Despite not having this technology, Zumi can still avoid obstacles!\n",

If something is directly in front of us, we have to either turn around or go around by turning away from the obtacle. Zumi uses the IR sensors to \"see\" and will make a decision based on the sensor data:\n",

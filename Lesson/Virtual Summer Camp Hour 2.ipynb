To get around this, you can use a loop, which lets you repeat parts of your code. They're a great shortcut --- without them, you would always have to write the same lines over and over again.

This is like indenting at the beginning of a paragraph to let the reader know there is a new topic and everything below is going to address that topic. A standard tab will be 4 spaces. Any code unindented after the loop will run after the loop is finished. Fix the indentations below:\n"

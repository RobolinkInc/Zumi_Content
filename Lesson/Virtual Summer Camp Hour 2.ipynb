    "<font size =3> You probably noticed that you repeated the same section of code four times. That's a lot of typing (or copying and pasting), and it can also lead to more errors! To get around this, you can use a loop, which lets you repeat parts of your code. They're a great shortcut --- without them, you would always have to write the same lines over and over again. They are called loops because the last statement loops around back to the beginning.</font>\n",

This is like indenting at the beginning of a paragraph to let the reader know there is a new topic and everything below is going to address that topic. A standard tab will be 4 spaces. Any code unindented after the loop will run after the loop is finished. Fix the indentations below:\n"
